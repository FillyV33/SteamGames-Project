# SteamGames-Project
This project involves data wrangling to run dependent t-tests on selected data for desired outcomes. There's also a presentation I made to go along with it showing of the data analysis. 

This is NOT an official project from Valve, it is a project I did by choice with a dataset I found. 

I also run through the explanation in my concluding slide in my powerpoint!
